# Examples Directory

This directory contains:
- README.md - Comprehensive guide to all 7 example configurations
- generate-all.sh - Script to generate all example projects locally

The generated example projects (01-minimal-package through 07-full-featured)
are not tracked in git as they are generated from the template.

To generate examples locally, run:
    ./generate-all.sh
