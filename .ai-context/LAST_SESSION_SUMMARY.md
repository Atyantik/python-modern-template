## What Was Done

Reviewed and updated template folder files for fresh project usability. Fixed 2 hardcoded placeholders: replaced 'yourusername' with {{ github_username }} in README.md.jinja and 'python-modern-template/' with {{ project_slug }}/ in AGENTS.md.jinja. All quality checks pass. Changes committed and pushed.
