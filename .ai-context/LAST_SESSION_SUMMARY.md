## What Was Done

Added mandatory documentation-first approach for all AI agents. Created comprehensive guidelines (AI_DOCS/documentation-first-approach.md) with MCP tools, WebFetch, and WebSearch workflows. Updated all AI tool configs (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .gemini, .github) and templates. Prevents over-engineering by requiring documentation research before implementation. All quality checks pass (200 tests, 86% coverage).
